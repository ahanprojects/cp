# Intuition & Approach
If you think about it, we just have to sell everytime its profitable, then buy again on the same day.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: $$O(n)$$
- Space complexity: $$O(1)$$ 

# Code
```ts
function maxProfit(prices: number[]): number {
    let profit = 0
    for (let i = 1; i < prices.length; i++) {
        if (prices[i] > prices[i-1]) {
            profit += prices[i] - prices[i-1]
        }
    }
    return profit
};

// This is basically the same
function maxProfit2(prices: number[]): number {
    let buy = prices[0]
    let profit = 0
    for (let i = 1; i < prices.length; i++) {
        buy = Math.min(buy, prices[i])
        if (prices[i] > buy) {
            profit += prices[i] - buy
            buy = prices[i]
        }
    }
    return profit
};

```
