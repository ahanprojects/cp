# Intuition
The easiest approach is to replace the last n elements of nums1 with all elements of nums2 (because the last n elements of nums 1 is 0), then sort nums1. But this approach is slow because sorting time complexity is at least O(n log n).

Because both nums1 and nums2 is already sorted, this problem can be solved in linear time.

# Approach
1. Create two pointer for each array, starting from the last element index (remember to use `m` and `n` instead of `nums1.length` or `nums2.length`). 
2. Iterate `nums1` from last to first. Compare `nums1[id1]` and `nums2[id2]`, and replace element in `nums1` with the greater element between the two (because both array is ascending).
3. Everytime an element is replaced, decrement `id1` or `id2`.
4. If `id2 < 0`, that means all elements of `nums2` is already appended to `nums1`.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: $$O(m + n)$$
Linear time, because we iterate through `nums1` and `nums2` only once each.

- Space complexity: $$O(1)$$
Constant time, because the amount of memory used by the algorithm does not change as the size of the input grows.

# Code
```ts
/**
 Do not return anything, modify nums1 in-place instead.
 */
function merge(nums1: number[], m: number, nums2: number[], n: number): void {
    if (n === 0) return
    
    let id1 = m - 1
    let id2 = n - 1
    for (let i = m + n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        if (nums1[id1] > nums2[id2]) {
            nums1[i] = nums1[id1]
            id1--
        }
        else {
            nums1[i] = nums2[id2]
            id2--
        }
        if (id2 < 0) break
    }
    return
};
