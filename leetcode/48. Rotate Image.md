# Intuition
We take 2x2 matrix for example. When rotation happens, elements swap will be performed 4 times. 0,0 => 1,0 => 1,1 => 0,1. For 4x4 matrix, we need to rotate the border and the 2x2 inside matrix.
Note: You can also transpose and reverse the matrix, you can find this solution in LeetCode. But I don't think this solution is intuitive.

# Approach
1. I created a `getter` and `setter` just so we can access the matrix using x,y coordinate system (start from top left) because it can be confusing
2. The first loop is for rotating every layer. For example, in 4x4 matrix, we will rotate the outer layer, then the inside layer (2x2).
3. We determine `z` as the "zero" index, and `n` as the last index.
4. We loop through the first `n-1` of the first row
5. We perform the swap, for each iteration, 4 cell will be swapped, because every cell in the matrix belongs in a set of 4
6. We have to find the mathematical relationship between those 4 cells.

# Complexity
- Time complexity
Loop through each layer $$= O(n/2)$$
Loop through $$n-1-layer$$ elements to swap $$â‰ˆ  O(n)$$
So the time complexity total is $$O(n^2)$$
- Space complexity: $$O(1)$$ because we change the memory in-place

# Code
```ts
/**
 Do not return anything, modify matrix in-place instead.
 */
function rotate(matrix: number[][]): void {
    const get = (x: number,y: number) => matrix[y][x]
    const set = (x: number, y: number, val: number) => matrix[y][x] = val

    for (let z = 0; z <=  Math.floor(matrix.length / 2); z++) {
        let n = matrix.length - z - 1
        if (z >= n) break

        for (let i = z; i < n; i++) {
            // [i,z] => [n,i] => [n-i+z,n] => [z,n-i+z]
            let temp = get(z,n-i+z)
            set(z, n-i+z, get(n-i+z,n))
            set(n-i+z,n, get(n,i))
            set(n,i, get(i,z))
            set(i,z,temp)

        }
    }
};

This is how I found out the mathematical relationship.
