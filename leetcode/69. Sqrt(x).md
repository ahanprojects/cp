# Intuition & Approach
Try and error. Set low and high bound. Calculate the middle (`mid`) value. Adjust `low` and `high` according to `mid * mid` value. Return the largest integer whose square is less than or equal to x.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: $$O(logn)$$
- Space complexity: $$O(1)$$

# Code
```ts
function mySqrt(x: number): number {
    let low = 0, high = x
    while (low <= high) {
        const mid = Math.floor((low + high)/2)
        if (mid * mid <= x) low = mid + 1
        else high = mid - 1
    }
    return high
};
```
