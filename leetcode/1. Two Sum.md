# Intuition
The easiest way is to use brute force with nested loop. Just try to add every pair of elements in the array until they adds up to target. The better way is to use hashmap to save the numbers and it's indexes.

# Approach
1. Calculate the different (`diff`) between `target` and `nums[i]`
2. If the number `diff` is in map, that means there is element in the `nums` array with the value of `diff`, and we already append it to the hashmap. We can get the index of that number, and returns it
3. Keep in mind the constraint that there are one exact correct answer.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: $$O(n)$$
- Space complexity: $$O(n)$$

# Code
```ts
function twoSum(nums: number[], target: number): number[] {
    let map = {} // num => index

    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        let diff = target - nums[i]
        if (diff in map) return [map[diff], i]
        map[nums[i]] = i
    }

    return [-1, -1] // not found
};
```
