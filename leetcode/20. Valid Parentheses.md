# Intuition & Approach
1. Create hashmap with close brackets as key and open brackets as value
2. Loop through `s`
3. If `b` is an open bracket, push it to `stack`
4. If `b` is a close bracket, get the top element of `stack` (last element of array). `top` should be an open bracket for it to be valid
5. If `top` is the right close bracket for `b`, that means the parenthesis is valid, remove `top` from `stack`
6. At the end, every open brackets must have its close brackets, so `stack` must be empty.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: $$O(n)$$
- Space complexity: $$O(n)$$
Space is linear because, in the worst case, `stack` must hold all the character in `s`. `brackets` hashmap is `O(1)` space.

# Code
```ts
function isValid(s: string): boolean {
    let stack = []
    const brackets = {
        ')': '(',
        '}': '{',
        ']': '[',
    }

    for (const b of s) {
        if (!brackets[b]) stack.push(b)
        else {
            const top = stack[stack.length - 1]
            if (top == brackets[b]) stack.pop()
            else return false
        }
    }

    return stack.length === 0
};
```
