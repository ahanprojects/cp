# Intuition & Approach
We can use brute force, by checking the letter of each element in the array, started from the first letter of each element, and so on until there's a difference. This will give at least $$O(n^2)$$ time.

The better approach is by sorting the array first. If the array is sorted, we only need to compare the prefixes of first and last element, because the other elements in between will have the same prefix.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: $$O(n log n)$$ + $$O(n)$$ = $$O(n log n)$$ 
    - Sort: $$O(n log n)$$
    - Iterate first and last elements: $$O(n)$$
- Space complexity: $$O(1)$$

# Code
```ts
function longestCommonPrefix(strs: string[]): string {
    strs.sort()
    
    let prefix = ''
    let first = strs[0]
    let last = strs[strs.length - 1]
    let i = 0

    while (i < first.length && i < last.length && first[i] === last[i]) {
        prefix += first[i]
        i++
    }

    return prefix
};
```
