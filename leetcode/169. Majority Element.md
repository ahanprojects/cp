# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
We can use hashmap to count the number of occurence for each elements, then return the element with the highest count. The time complexity will be $$O(n)$$ (iterate `nums` once, then find the highest count in hashmap), the space complexity will be $$O(n)$$ (hashmap size depends on `nums`).

The better approach is using **Moore's Voting Algorithm**.

# Approach
Variable `candidate` will save the majority element, and `count` will be used to determine if an element is majority element. This algorithm works under the assumption that the majority element always exist in the array. 

There will be two scenario when the loop is done:
1. `count > 0`: This means that `candidate` appears more than `n/2` times in the array. In other words, more than half elements in the array is `candidate`. `candidate` must be the majority element.
2. `count = 0`: This means there will be an equal number of occurrences for the majority element and the remaining elements combined. At the end, `candidate` will still be the majority element because it will appears more than the other elements, remember the assumption.

`count` will never be negative.
# Complexity
- Time complexity: $$O(n)$$
- Space complexity: $$O(1)$$

# Code
```ts
function majorityElement(nums: number[]): number {
    let candidate = nums[0]
    let count = 1

    for (let i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
        if (candidate === nums[i]) count++
        else count--

        if (count === 0) {
            candidate = nums[i]
            count++
        }
    }

    return candidate
};
```
