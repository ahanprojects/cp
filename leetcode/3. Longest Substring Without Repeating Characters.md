# Approach
I use hashMap to store the index of elements. The most important thing is to know when to move the `l` pointer.
1. We move the `r` pointer using for loop, iterating all elements
2. There are two conditions that must be met to know if we have a duplicate in our current window
    a. `charMap.has(s[r])`, this means we have already found the char `s[r]` before, but we aren't sure if this char is inside the current window. 
    b. `charMap.get(s[r]) >= l`, this means that char `s[r]` index is greater our `l` pointer, which means `s[r]` index is inside the current window.
3. If there is duplicate in the current window, we have to remove all elements from `l` to `s[r]` index to remove the duplicate. We do that by moving `l` pointer to `s[r]` index + 1.
4. For every iteration of `r`, we find the maximum `len` and add `s[r]` to `charMap`.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: $$O(n)$$
- Space complexity: $$O(1)$$, because `s` consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.

# Code
```ts
function lengthOfLongestSubstring(s: string): number {
    let charMap = new Map() // char => index
    let l = 0, len = 0
    for (let r = 0; r < s.length; r++) {
        if (charMap.has(s[r]) && charMap.get(s[r]) >= l) {
            l = charMap.get(s[r]) + 1
        }
        len = Math.max(len, r - l + 1)
        charMap.set(s[r], r)
    }
    return len
};
```
