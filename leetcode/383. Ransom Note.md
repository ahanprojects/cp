# Intuition & Approach
Create a hashmap for both `ransomNote` and `magazine`, with character as key and character's count as value. After both hashmap created, loop through `ransomMap` character. If `magazineMap` doesn't have the character, or the character's count is less than `ransomMap`, that means we don't have enough character to create the `ransomNote`.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: $$O(r + m)$$
Linear time, because we iterate through `ransomNote` and `magazine` once. Also, remember the time complexity of getting value from a hashmap is $$O(1)$$.

Note: We also iterate through `ransomMap`, which is $$O(r)$$ time complexity, so the total time complexity should be $$O(2r + m)$$, but we can ignore coeficients.
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

- Space complexity: $$O(1)$$
Why doesn't the space complexity $$O(r + m)$$?
it's because of the constraint, "*ransomNote and magazine consist of lowercase English letters*". This means, the maximum number of keys in both hashmaps is 26, which is constant.

# Code
```ts
function canConstruct(ransomNote: string, magazine: string): boolean {
    let ransomMap = {}
    let magazineMap = {}

    // Create Map
    for (let c of ransomNote) {
        ransomMap[c] = (ransomMap[c] ?? 0) + 1
    }
    for (let c of magazine) {
        magazineMap[c] = (magazineMap[c] ?? 0) + 1
    }

    // Check
    for (let c in ransomMap) {
        if (!magazineMap[c] || magazineMap[c] < ransomMap[c]) return false
    }
    return true
