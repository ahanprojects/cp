# Approach 1 (Turtoise and Hare)
You can read about the turtoise and hare algorithm. We create two pointers, pointer `slow` moves one node at a time, pointer `fast` moves two nodes at a time. The idea is, if there is a cycle, at one point, `slow` and `fast` will be at the same node. Just imagine two people run around a circle with one person moves twice as fast. At one point, the faster person will meet with the slower person and then overlap him.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: $$O(n)$$
Why linear? It's because when `fast` and `slow` meet at the same node, the worst case is `fast` will traverse all the nodes once. You can watch the neetcode youtube explanation, it's really good.
- Space complexity: $$O(1)$$

# Approach 2 (HashSet)
Create a set to save all the traversed nodes. Everytime we move to the next node, check if the node already traversed.

# Code
```ts
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * class ListNode {
 *     val: number
 *     next: ListNode | null
 *     constructor(val?: number, next?: ListNode | null) {
 *         this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val)
 *         this.next = (next===undefined ? null : next)
 *     }
 * }

function hasCycle(head: ListNode | null): boolean {
    let slow = head, fast = head

        slow = slow.next
        fast = fast.next.next
        if (slow == fast) return true
    }

    return false
}

function hasCycle2(head: ListNode | null): boolean {
    let seen = new Set()
    while (head != null) {
        if (seen.has(head)) return true
        seen.add(head)
        head = head.next

    return false
