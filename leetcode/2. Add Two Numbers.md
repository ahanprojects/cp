# Intuition
Because the lists is reversed, we can traverse and add from the head to tail.

# Approach
1. Initialize empty node for dummy head, we will return the real head which is `head.next`
2. While `l1` is not null, or `l2` is not null, or there is still a `remainder`,
3. Add the two nodes and remainder
4. If the `sum` is less than 10, create a node with value `sum`, and set remainder to `0`. Else, set the value to `sum - 10` and remainder to `1`
5. Go to the next node if the current node is not null.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: $$O(n)$$ with $$n$$ as the highest length between `l1` and `l2`
- Space complexity: $$O(n + 1) â‰ˆ O(n)$$, it's $$n+1$$ because for the worst case we have to create a new node with value 1, for example [9] + [1] = [1,0]. But of course we ignore the $$+1$$ so, it's $$O(n)$$.

# Code
```ts
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * class ListNode {
 *     val: number
 *     next: ListNode | null
 *     constructor(val?: number, next?: ListNode | null) {
 *         this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val)
 *         this.next = (next===undefined ? null : next)
 *     }
 * }
 */

function addTwoNumbers(l1: ListNode | null, l2: ListNode | null): ListNode | null {
    let head = new ListNode() // dummy head
    let i = head
    let remainder = 0

    while (l1 || l2 || remainder > 0) {
        let sum = (l1?.val ?? 0) + (l2?.val ?? 0) + remainder
        if (sum < 10) {
            i.next = new ListNode(sum)
            remainder = 0
        }
        else {
            i.next = new ListNode(sum - 10)
            remainder = 1
        }
        
        l1 = l1?.next
        l2 = l2?.next
        i = i.next
    }

    return head.next

};
