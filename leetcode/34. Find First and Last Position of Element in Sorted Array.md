# Intuition & Approach
Perform binary search until we found `target`. After that, we'll go right and left while until the starting and ending position.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: $$O(logn)$$
- Space complexity: $$O(1)$$

# Code
```ts
function searchRange(nums: number[], target: number): number[] {
    let left = 0, right = nums.length - 1
    while (left <= right) {
        const mid = Math.floor((left + right)/2)
        if (nums[mid] == target) {
            let i = mid, j = mid
            while (nums[i-1] == target) i--
            while (nums[j+1] == target) j++
            return [i, j]
        }
        if (nums[mid] < target) left = mid + 1
        else right = mid - 1
    }

    return [-1,-1]
};
```
