We can just split the string into array by whitespace, then return the length of the last element of array. Because multiple white space could be in the end of string, we have to trim the string first.

# Approach 1
Simply trim the string (to remove whitespaces in the end of string) then split it by whitespace. 

# Approach 2
This approach is more proper "DSA" way, not specific to a programming language and no weird TypeScript magic lol.
1. Start from the end of string, because we only need the last word
2. Check if `s[i] == ' '` and `lastWord` is not empty, that means we have the last word, exit from the loop.
3. If `s[i]` is not a whitespace, append it to lastWord

# Complexity
- Time complexity: $$O(n)$$
- Space complexity: $$O(1)$$

# Code
```ts
// Approach 1
function lengthOfLastWord(s: string): number {
    const splitted = s.trim().split(' ')
    return splitted[splitted.length - 1].length
};

// Approach 2
function lengthOfLastWord(s: string): number {
    let lastWord = ''

    for (let i = s.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        if (s[i] === ' ' && lastWord !== '') break
        if (s[i] !== ' ') lastWord += s[i]
    }

    return lastWord.length
};
```
