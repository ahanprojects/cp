# Intuition
###### Brute force approach:
1. Count all occurence of `val` in `nums` (for example `k`), and replace it with -1 (or whatever outside the constraint)
2. Sort `nums` in descending order (move all -1 in the back of array)
3. Return `nums - k`

Brute force is not optimized because it needs sorting, there must be a better solution with linear time.
# Approach
1. Variable `k` will be a pointer of the array. `k` will also count how many elements in `nums` are not equal with `val`.
2. Iterate through `nums`. Everytime `nums[i] != val`, replace `nums[k]` with `nums[i]`, then increment `k`.
# Complexity
- Time complexity: $$O(n)$$
Linear time, because array iteration is only done once

- Space complexity: $$O(1)$$.
Constant space

# Code
```ts
function removeElement(nums: number[], val: number): number {
    let k = 0
    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        if (nums[i] !== val) {
            nums[k] = nums[i]
            k++
        }
    }
    return k 
};
```
