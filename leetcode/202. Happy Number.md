# Intuition
Just code what the problem is asking for. Convert the number into string to access each digit. Create a "infinite loop" to sum the squared digits over and over again, until it's only one digit. The tricky part is to know when to exit the loop.

# Approach 1 (Hashmap)
We want to prevent the loop from running forever because the sum never equals to 1. To do that, everytime we calculated a sum, we save the result to a hashmap (I use set for this problem). Before we calculate the sum, we need to check if this number already appeared in set. If it is already in set, we know that this calculation will be cyclic and the loop will be running infinitely. So we exit from the loop and return false. If the sum is 1, return true.

# Approach 2 (Without Hashmap)
The tricky part is we have to know that the one digit number that will resulted in 1 is 1 and 7. So stop the loop if we get 1 or 7. How could you know that 7 will resulted in 1? That is the real question.

# Complexity
This is a good explanation i get from ChatGPT on why the time complexity is $$O(log n)$$

Let's break down why the time complexity of the Happy Number problem is often approximated as O(log n).

In the Happy Number problem, we repeatedly compute the sum of the squares of the digits of the number until we either reach 1 (a happy number) or we encounter a cycle (an unhappy number).

Consider a number `n` with d digits.

Sum of Squares of Digits: In each iteration, we compute the sum of the squares of the digits of n. The number of digits in `n` is proportional to `log n`. This is because in base 10, the number of digits required to represent a number `n` is roughly log10(n). For simplicity, we can consider it as `log n`.

Updating the Number: After computing the sum of the squares of the digits, we update `n` with this new value. Updating `n` doesn't take more than O(`log n`) time because it involves extracting and summing the squares of each digit, which is proportional to the number of digits in n.

Detecting a Cycle or Reaching 1: We repeat this process until we either reach 1 (a happy number) or we encounter a number that we have seen before, indicating a cycle. In the worst case scenario, the sequence of numbers before reaching 1 or a cycle can't be longer than the total number of possible integers between `n` and 1. Since we're reducing `n` in each step, this is proportional to `log n`.

Overall, the time complexity of the Happy Number problem is mainly driven by the number of iterations required to reach 1 or detect a cycle, and each iteration involves operations proportional to the number of digits in the number, which is roughly `log n`.

Therefore, the time complexity is approximated as $$O(log n)$$.

# Code
```ts
function isHappy(n: number): boolean {
    const seen = new Set()

    let num = n
    while (true) {
        let sum = 0
        for (let d of num.toString()) sum += Number(d) ** 2

        if (sum === 1) return true
        if (seen.has(sum)) return false // cyclic
        seen.add(sum)

        num = sum
    }
    return false
};

function isHappy2(n: number): boolean {
    if (n === 1 || n === 7) return true

    let result = n.toString()
    while (result.length > 1) {
        let sum = 0
        for (let num of result) {
            sum += Number(num) ** 2
        }
        if (sum === 1 || sum === 7) return true

        result = sum.toString()
    }
    return false
};

// Same with isHappy but more concise
function isHappy3(n: number): boolean {
    const seen = new Set()
    while (n != 1 && !seen.has(n)) {
        seen.add(n)
        n = n.toString().split('').reduce((prev, acc) => prev + Number(acc) ** 2, 0)
    }
    return n === 1
};
