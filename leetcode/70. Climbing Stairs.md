# Intuition & Approach
It took time to find the pattern. But this is basically fibbonaci sequence. You can draw a stair to find the pattern. Because you're allowed to move 1 or 2 steps, the result of `n` is the result of `n-1` + result of `n-2`.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: $$O(n)$$
- Space complexity: $$O(n)$$ for recursive approach, $$O(1)$$ for the iterative.

# Code
```ts
function climbStairs(n: number): number {
    let one = 1, two = 1
    for (let i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) [one, two] = [one + two, one]
    return one
}

function climbStairs2(n: number, memo = {}): number {
    if (memo[n]) return memo[n]
    if (n < 3) return n
    memo[n] = climbStairs2(n - 1, memo) + climbStairs2(n - 2, memo)
    return memo[n]
};

```
