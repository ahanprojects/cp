# Intuition & Approach
Remember the array is sorted. We create a pointer `k` for reassigning `nums` elements. For easier explanation, lets call the end array without duplicates as array `unique`. There are two main condition to assigning element to this array:
1. `k < 2`. This means `unique` array has less than two elements. In other words, unique element **appears at most twice**.
2. `nums[i] != nums[k - 2]`. When `unique` array has more than 3 elements, there is a possibility of unique element appears more than twice. So we check if two elements behind `nums[k]` is equal to `nums[i]`. We don't need to check `nums[k-1]` because even though `nums[k-1] == nums[i]`, an element is allowed to appear twice.
```ts
[ a ,a,b, c] : Valid, because nums[i] != nums[k-2]
       i
 k-2   k
[ a ,a,a, c] : invalid, because nums[i] == nums[k-2]
       i
 k-2   k
```

# Complexity
- Time complexity: $$O(n)$$
- Space complexity: $$O(1)$$

# Code
```ts
function removeDuplicates(nums: number[]): number {
    let k = 0
    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        if (k < 2 || nums[i] != nums[k - 2]) {
            nums[k] = nums[i]
            k++
        }
    }
    return k
};         
```
