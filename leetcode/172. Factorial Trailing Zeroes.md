# Intuition & Approach
We need to determine how many factors of 10 are in the factorial. Since a factor of 10 is obtained from multiplying 5 and 2 together, and since the number of factors of 2 is always greater than or equal to the number of factors of 5, we only need to count the number of factors of 5 in the prime factorization of the numbers from 1 to `n`.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: $$O(\log(n))$$
- Space complexity: $$O(1)$$

# Code
```ts
function trailingZeroes(n: number): number {
    let div = 5
    let count = 0
    while (div <= n) {
        count += Math.floor(n / div)
        div *= 5
    }
    return count
};
```
