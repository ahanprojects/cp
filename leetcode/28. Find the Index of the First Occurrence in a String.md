# Intuition
Easy brute force: Loop through haystack once, check if needle is equal with substring of haystack (`haystack.slice(i, i + needle.length)`), return i. This approach will have $$O(h*m)$$ time complexity, because the `slice` method is $$O(m)$$ and this method called inside `haystack` loop.

Note: For string matching, you can use KMP search ($$O(m+n)$$ time and $$O(m)$$ space), but it is fairly complex.

# Approach
I just realized that my approach is not any better with the intuition :(  
Create two pointers (`n` for needle and `i` for haystack). Everytime `needle[n]` and `haystack[i]` have the same character, increment the pointers. 
`checkpoint` is used to save the the first character of `needle` index in `haystack`. When `needle[n] != haystack[i]`, we reset `n` and reset `i` value to to `checkpoint` (backtrack), so the next iteration `i` value will be `checkpoint + 1`. 

Btw, we can also use TypeScript array function like this: `haystack.indexOf(needle)`.


# Complexity
- Time complexity: O(m * n)
- Space complexity: O(h)
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

# Code
```ts
function strStr(haystack: string, needle: string): number {
    let n = 0, checkpoint = 0

    for (let i = 0; i < haystack.length; i++) {
        if (n == 0) checkpoint = i

        if (needle[n] == haystack[i]) n++
        else {
            n = 0
            i = checkpoint
        }
        
        if (n == needle.length) return checkpoint
    }

    return -1
};
```
