# Approach
I use sliding window technique for this problem (duh).
1. Initiate the variables
2. Expand the window (increment `r`)
3. Add value to `sum`
4. While `sum >= target`, we shrink the window by incrementing `l`. For every iteration we also calculate the minimum length and subtract `nums[l]` from the `sum`
5. For the return value, if `len == Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`, that means the sum of all elements is less than target, so we return 0. In other words, the code never reaches this line `len = Math.min(len, r - l + 1)`, which also means that sum is never greater or equal to target.
# Complexity
- Time complexity: $$O(n)$$
- Space complexity: $$O(1)$$

# Code
```ts
function minSubArrayLen(target: number, nums: number[]): number {
    let l = 0, r = 0, sum = 0, len = Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER
    while (r < nums.length) {
        sum += nums[r]
        while (sum >= target) {
            len = Math.min(len, r - l + 1)
            sum -= nums[l]
            l++
        }
        r++
    }
    return len == Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER ? 0 : len
};
```
