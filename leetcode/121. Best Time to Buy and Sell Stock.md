# Intuition
We can solve the problem using brute force. Just create a nested loop, the outer loop is for buy (minimum price), and the inner loop is for sell (maximum price). Find the highest profit (`sell - buy`). The time complexity will be $$O(n^2)$$.

The better approach is to find the highest profit by iterating the array once.

# Approach
1. Iterate the `prices` array
2. Find the lower price between the current lowest price (`buy`) and `prices[i]`
3. Find the higher profit between the current `profit` and the new profit if we sell at `prices[i]`

# Complexity
- Time complexity: $$O(n)$$
- Space complexity: $$O(1)$$

# Code
```js
function maxProfit(prices: number[]): number {
    let buy = prices[0]
    let profit = 0

    for (let i = 1; i < prices.length; i++) {
        buy = Math.min(buy, prices[i])
        profit = Math.max(profit, prices[i] - buy)
    }
    return profit
};
```
