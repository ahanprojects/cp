# Intuition &  Approach
We can use two pointers, `j` for `s` and `i` for `t`. We iterate through `t`, and everytime `t[i]` equals with `s[j]`, we increment `j`, so in the next iteration, we will check for the next character of `s`. In the end, if `j` equal with number of characters of `s`, we know that `s` is subsequence of `t`.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: Linear time. $$O(s + t)$$ 
- Space complexity: $$O(1)$$

# Code
```ts
function isSubsequence(s: string, t: string): boolean {
    let j = 0
    for (let i = 0; i < t.length; i++) {
        if (s[j] === t[i]) j++
        if (j >= s.length) break
    }
    return j === s.length
};
```
