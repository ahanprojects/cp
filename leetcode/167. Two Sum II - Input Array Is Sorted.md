# Intuition & Approach
Because we have to do it in constant space, we cannot use hashmap, so we use two pointers. Because the array is sorted in an ascending order, we just need to try adding `numbers[left]` and `numbers[right]` until it is equal to target. if the `sum` is too high, we move the `right` pointer to the left, if it is too low we move the `left` pointer to the right.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: $$O(n)$$
- Space complexity: $$O(1)$$

# Code
```ts
function twoSum(numbers: number[], target: number): number[] {
    let left = 0
    let right = numbers.length - 1

    while (left < right) {
        const sum = numbers[left] + numbers[right]
        if (sum === target) return [left + 1, right + 1]
        else if (sum < target) left++
        else right--
    }

    return [0, 0]
};
```
