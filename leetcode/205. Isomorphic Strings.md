# Intuition & Approach
We can use hashmap to map `s` to `t`. Because one character from `s` can only equivalent to one character of `t`, we have to know if the `t` already have it's `s` equivalent. We use set to save mapped `t` characters. We use Set instead of array because the time complexity for lookup in set is $$O(1)$$, also set elements are unique.

There are two main condition to check inside the loop:
1. If `cs` in `stMap`, this means this s character already mapped to `t` before. Then we check if the mapped `s` character is equal to `ct`. If not equal then it is not isomorphic.
2. If `cs` not in `stMap`, this means the s character is a new character, so we must map this character to `ct`. There is a possibility that `ct` already used, if `ct` already used then we can't map `cs` to `ct`, because `ct` already has it's equivalent 

If `cs` and `ct` have not been mapped, add it to the hashmap and set.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: Linear time. $$O(n)$$

- Space complexity
The space complexity is $$O(k)$$, with k as the number of unique character of `s`. But because of this constraint, "*`s` and `t` consist of any valid ascii character.*" I think the space complexity is constant, $$O(1)$$. Because there are a constant number of valid ascii character, which is 128, and this wouldn't change when we change the input strings.

# Code
```ts
function isIsomorphic(s: string, t: string): boolean {
    if (s.length !== t.length) return false

    let stMap = {}
    let usedT = new Set()

    for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
        const cs = s[i], ct = t[i]

        if (cs in stMap && ct !== stMap[cs]) return false
        if (!(cs in stMap) && usedT.has(ct)) return false
        
        stMap[cs] = ct
        usedT.add(ct)
    }

    return true
};
```
