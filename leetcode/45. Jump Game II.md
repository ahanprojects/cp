# Intuition
This is hard, maybe I should try every possible combination and add memoization?

# Approach
We can use greedy approach. Note, we did not jump in every iteration, but only when `i` has reached our current position, then we update our position to the furthest possible.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: $$O(n)$$
- Space complexity: $$O(1)$$

# Code
```ts
function jump(nums: number[]): number {
    let jumps = 0
    let position = 0
    let maxReachableIndex = 0

    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length - 1; i++) {
        maxReachableIndex = Math.max(maxReachableIndex, i + nums[i])
        if (i == position) {
            jumps++
            position = maxReachableIndex
        }
    }
    
    return jumps
};
```
