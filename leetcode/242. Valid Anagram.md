# Intuition & Approach
Count the number of characters in `s` and `t`, and check if all the number of characters in `s` are equal with `t`. We can also sort both strings first and compare them, but sorting is not the most optimized solution for this problem, because of sort's time complexity.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: $$O(n)$$
- Space complexity: $$O(1)$$
The space complexity is $$O(k)$$, with k as the number of unique character in s. But, because of the constraint "*s and t consist of lowercase English letters.*", the space complexity is constant ($$O(1)$$) because we know that the maximum number of attributes in the hashmap is 26.

# Code
```ts
function isAnagram(s: string, t: string): boolean {
    if (s.length !== t.length) return false

    const sCountMap = {}
    const tCountMap = {}
    for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
        sCountMap[s[i]] = (sCountMap[s[i]] ?? 0) + 1
        tCountMap[t[i]] = (tCountMap[t[i]] ?? 0) + 1
    }

    for (let k in sCountMap) {
        if (sCountMap[k] !== tCountMap[k]) return false
    }

    return true
};

function isAnagramTypeScript(s: string, t: string): boolean {
    return s.split('').sort().join('') === t.split('').sort().join('')
};
```
