# Intuition & Approach
Create hashmap, with sorted `str` as key and array as value.
# Complexity
- Time complexity
  - $$O(n)$$ for traversing every elements of `strs`
  - $$O(k log (k))$$ for generating key (sorting) where `k` is the length of the longest `str`, because we do this `n` times, the total would be $$O(n * k log(k))$$
  - $$O(m)$$ for creating the result array, where `m` is the number of distinct groups

Since we're interested in the dominant term, the time complexity of the code is $$O(n * klog(k))$$.

- Space complexity
In the worst case, where there are no anagrams and each string is unique, the space complexity would be $$O(n * k)$$, where `n` is the number of strings and `k` is the length of the longest string. However, in the best case where all strings are anagrams of each other, there would only be one group, resulting in space complexity $$O(n)$$.

# Code
```ts
function groupAnagrams(strs: string[]): string[][] {
    const group = {}
    for (let i = 0; i < strs.length; i++) {
        let key = strs[i].split('').sort().join('')
        if (key in group) group[key].push(strs[i])
        else group[key] = [strs[i]]
    }

    return Object.values(group)
};
```
