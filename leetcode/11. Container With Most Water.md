<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->

# Approach
1. Start from both ends of the array
2. We wan't to maximize the distance between the two pointer (`r - l`),and find the minimum height between `height[l]` and `height[r]` to calculate the area.
3. Then we move the pointer of the lower height between `l` and `r`

# Complexity
- Time complexity: $$O(n)$$
- Space complexity: $$O(1)$$

# Code
```ts
function maxArea(height: number[]): number {
    let l = 0, r = height.length - 1
    let area = 0

    while (l < r) {
        let y = Math.min(height[l], height[r])
        area = Math.max(area, y * (r - l))
        if (height[l] < height[r]) l++
        else r--
    }
    return area
};
```
