# Intuition & Approach
The base case is when we are on a leaf node, we check if the `sum` is equal to `targetSum`. When we haven't reach a leaf, we keep going and check the left and right node. We add `root.val` for every node we traversed.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: $$O(n)$$. Worst case is we need to traverse all nodes
- Space complexity: $$O(n)$$. This is due to the recursion stack space used by the recursive calls. In the worst case scenario, the tree could be skewed (i.e., all nodes are on one side), resulting in $$O(n)$$ recursion stack space being used.
# Code
```ts
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * class TreeNode {
 *     val: number
 *     left: TreeNode | null
 *     right: TreeNode | null
 *     constructor(val?: number, left?: TreeNode | null, right?: TreeNode | null) {
 *         this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val)
 *         this.left = (left===undefined ? null : left)
 *         this.right = (right===undefined ? null : right)
 *     }
 * }
 */

function hasPathSum(root: TreeNode | null, targetSum: number, sum = 0): boolean {
    if (root == null) return false

    const newSum = sum + root.val
    if (!root.left && !root.right) return targetSum == newSum

    return hasPathSum(root.left, targetSum, newSum) || hasPathSum(root.right, targetSum, newSum) 
};
